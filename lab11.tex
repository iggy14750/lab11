    \section{Purpose}
        The purpose of this lab is to implement a simple circuit using a 4x4 register file, and test it using seven-segment displays.
        %Registers are basic components of any computer system, used as temporary storage.
        This circuit consisted of two counters being fed into the read and write input of our register file, four switches in the write data input, and two seven segment displays, fed through decoders, one from the read data output of our register file, and the other directly from our switches.
        This circuit was an exercise in applying the theory: we might know what bits are write/read select, etc, but it's worth seeing the particular constraints put upon a physical implementation of this component.
        %What the fuck does this mean?

        As instructed, this specification was first tested in software, using Quartus II.
